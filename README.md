# 📦 FilePacker-Unpacker

A **Java-based file utility tool** that allows you to **pack multiple files into a single archive** and later **unpack them with all metadata preserved**.

For enhanced security, packed archives are **encrypted** and can only be **decrypted by authorized users**.
The project also includes a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with **Swing** for user-friendly interaction.
